### Brief

This project presents a probabilistic binary neural network according to the paper published on ICLR. We implemented all functions in the paper including the embracement of stochasticity in training process and stochastic versions of Batch Normalization, as well as sampling in binary activations. A similar result to the original paper was obtained after experiment.
